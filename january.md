At a meeting in Edinburgh, I told several colleagues about
our 'Learning a New Language' project. I got some interesting
advice. Phil Wadler and Rob Stewart both independently suggested
Rust as an interesting language to explore. Phil also advised me
not to learn a language "by diff" - meaning I shouldn't just play
"spot the difference" between the new language and languages I
already know. He says that's how lots of people try to learn their
first functional language, and it generally confuses them.

Today we have the first meeting of the "Learning a New Language"
reading group in Glasgow. I am going for Rust. Here's what I did
before the meeting.

# downloaded the rust compiler and sdk
# compiled an example hello world rust program.

fn main() {
    println!("hello world")
}

# ran the program! It worked first time.

Things that confused me.
# Why does println need an exclamation mark after it?
# Does main have a return value?

Things I probably expected:
# main is called main
# Strings look like strings.


Derek suggested we should learn by creating solutions to
well-known problems, learning by construction and by following
examples.
Example-driven learning in Rust is well-supported with the
online textbook [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).
